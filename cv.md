### About me:
I am studying at BSUIR. Most of the time spent at the university I learnt such technologies as:
+ Delphi, Pascal
+ Assemly language (FASM), C
+ C# and .NET (WPF, ASP)
+ PHP and MySQL
+ VS, PHPStorm, PyCharm, WebStorm
+ Basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Now I've started to show interest in learning the Front-end and I am very fond of creating outstanding visualisation of any content like web-pages or user interfaces. I am communicative, hard-working and fast-learning. Also, I love learning new things about any sphere of knowledge. I don't like to quit unfinished business or give up in the face of difficulties.
I have some experience in team work, I took party in 2 hackathons. Furthermore I often develop and discuss some out-of-university projects with my mates.
